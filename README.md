# Bike Trip Analysis

## Project Overview

This analysis is for pitching purposes to show investors that implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The program has been successful in New York City, this analysis provides further details on ridership during August 2019 to make recommedations on how it can be successfully replicated in Des Moines. This [NYC Citibike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fatima.bz/viz/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16744116152310/NYCCitibikeAnalysis) has a summary of the findings, each graph is further explained in the results section below.

## NYC Citibike Analysis Results

1. **August Peak Hours**: this is an indicator of when users tend to begin their rides. As seen in the bar chart, the top riding hours during August in New York City are 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

2. **Trips by Weekday per Hour**: this heatmap shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day.The number of bike trips by weekday is higher during typical AM and PM rush hours. Based on these two first graphs, bikes should be available during the AM and PM rush hours and maintenance should be done early in the morning when ridership is at the lowest.

3. **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)**: this graph indicates the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. The heatmap shows that the majority of users during rush hours are male users. This information will be helpful when planning marketing campaigns on social media.

4. **Checkout Times for Users**: this line chart indicates the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. The majority of rides are between 1 and 20 minutes. This data will help determine how many bikes are needed in Des Moines and the ride times offered based on the city's area.

5. **Checkout Times by Gender**: this graph derives from the previous one. It shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender. The results show Male users tend to take longer rides.

6. **User Trips by Gender by Weekday**: this heatmap shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. Subscriber ridership is higher on Thursdays and Fridays; and, the majority of Citibike's subscribers are male.

7. **Top Starting Locations**: this map indicates popular stations in the city for starting a bike journey. The most popular starting locations are nearby mass transportation stations and tourist attractions.

8. **Top Ending Locations**: this map indicates popular stations in the city for ernding a bike ride. The most popular ending locations are nearby mass transportation stations, business hubs, and tourist attractions. These last two graphs will help identify station locations in Des Moines. Stations should be nearby other means of transportation and popular social areas.

## Summary

The Citibike program has been successful in New York City. The findings above allow us to start planning the development of a bikesharing program in Des Moines. For example, most of the bike fleet should be available during rush hours and maintenance done at off-peak hours; marketing efforts should be primarly directed towards a male audience but also encourage female ridership; and finally, stations should be mapped out based on Des Moines' mass transit hubs, business centers, and tourist attractions as those will potentially be the most popular pick-up and drop-off locations. 

There are two graphs that would enhance this analysis:
* Ride length by age and gender to further customize marketing campaigns, and
* Comparison between the total rides during the busiest summer month (August) and the slowest winter month to determine if the business is profitable year-round.
